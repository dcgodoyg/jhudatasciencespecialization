The data set used comes from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This agency is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data used are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

####DATA

The data for this assignment are available from the course web site as a single zip file:

PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.

#####Variables Description
fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county

SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)

Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant

Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons

type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)

year: The year of emissions recorded

####Assignment

![plot1](plot1.png) 

######Answer:

Yes, total emissions from PM2.5 in the United States from 1999 to 2008 have decreased



#####Question 2:

![plot2](plot2.png) 

######Answer:

Yes, total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008.



####Question 3:

Of the four types of sources indicated by the type variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?

![plot3](plot3.png) 

######Answer:

Althoug point source type plummeted from 2005 to 2008, the last reading is still higher than it was in 1999.
Non-road, nonpoint and on-road have seen decreases from 1999 to 2008.



####Question 4:
